xPo is a way to summarise attacking strategy in football. The contents can be
viewed at https://thecomeonman.github.io/xPo/.

A sample of having a dashboard to use xPo to prepare for a match is available
here https://thecomeonman.github.io/xPoDashboard/.

An R script to calculate xPo values using Statsbomb open data is available in
the repository.
