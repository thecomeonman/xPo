        Update on 11th April 2020: There was a calculation error which caused passes 
        and moves to not get equal weightage as shots which diminised their 
        contribution. It's been fixed now.
        </i>
    <p>

    <h3>What is xPo?</h3>

    <p>
        xPo expands to expected potential.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Do We Need xPo?</h3>

    <p>
        I wanted to figure out a way to measure the value of various 
        attacking actions on the pitch. xPo is just an estimate of the 
        potential xG an action could eventually generate.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I've listed some differences with the 
        most commonly used method, xG Chain, and a recently popular method, xT
        in the Comparisons With Other Models section.
    </p>

    <h3>What is xG?</h3>

    <p>
        For those not familiar with xG, it's just a probability assigned to a 
        shot for it ending up in a goal. There are multiple ways to calculate it
        and you'll find a whole host of material about it online.
    </p>

    <p>
        I need xG to calculate xPo and I employ probably the most simplest of 
        methods to calculate xG which I describe later. 
    </p>

    <h3>How is xPo calculated?</h3>

    <p>
        If you have the ball, then there are three things you can do with it:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>Pass it to some place</li>
    <li>Run with it to some place</li>
    <li>Shoot</li>
    </ul> 

    <p>
        Each of those actions may or may not eventually lead to a goal but we can 
        estimate how often they are 
        likely to lead to one. To do that, I evaluate three sets of numbers -
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            xPo for shots: This is the same as the xG of those shots.
        </li>
        <li>
            xPo for passes: In the same spirit as xG, I evaluate the eventual xG 
            a play is likely to generate after a pass moving the ball from one 
            area of the pitch to another.
        </li>
        <li>
            xPo for runs: Calculated in the same way as xPo for passes
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The xPo for a shot is the same as the xG for a shot so first we calculate
        xG for all the shots we have in the database. This is
        straightforward - we take all shots from a certain area of the pitch,
        see how many of them were goals, and the xG for that area of the pitch 
        is therefore the number of goals / number of shots for that area. We
        could use more sophisticated measures of xG if we could calculate it,
        but we'll keep it simple for now.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once we've calculated the xG for all areas of the pitch, we can
        attribute these xG values back to the shots. Now onwards we care about 
        the xG for a shot, and we don't care about the actual result of the shot
        being a goal or not anymore.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now we start looking at calculating xPo for passes and runs. 
        Let's say that in the first play that we look at there
        were 5 passes and 3 runs and that play eventually resulted in a shot 
        with an xG of 0.3. All 5 passes and all 3 runs would get an equal and
        complete credit of an xPo of 0.3. Let's say the next play were looking
        at didn't result in a shot then all the actions in that play get credited
        with an xPo of 0.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        It so happens that both the plays described above had a pass that originated
        in the same area as each other and ended in the same area as each other,
        i.e. we have two instances of a similar pass being played, one in each play. 
        In one case the eventual xG is 0.3, and in the other the eventual xG is 0. 
        The average eventual xG for such a pass therefore is 0.15 so we update
        the xPo for that pass as 0.15.
    </p>

    <p>
        We continue this process across all plays, considering all runs and all
        passes and keep aggregating the eventual xG generated by similar passes
        and runs. When we've finally gone through all the plays, we arrive at
        the final xPo value for every particular action a team has performed.
        Every pass between a set of coordinates, every run between a set of 
        coordinates, and every shot from any coordinate now has an xPo value.
        Ta da!
    </p>

    <p>
        However, given the limited quantity of football that gets played, it's 
        not feasible to get enough samples of a pass or a run or a shot at exactly
        the same set of coordinates. To get around this, I include events starting
        and ending in areas around the specific set of coordinates being looked 
        at as well. The farther these other events are from the exact pair of 
        coordinates, the lesser weightage they get in the final xPo calculation
        for those coordinates.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Processing</h3>

    <p>
        I have had to infer plays and runs from events data. I marked plays 
        based on criteria like whether the team making the passes changed, or 
        if the ball went out of play, etc. I extracted runs as all movement 
        between the end coordinate of
        a pass and the start coordinate of the next pass. There are likely some
        edge cases that will sneak though and look funny but I'm working on
        making this better too. A large proportion of the data is still correct
        though so I'm still letting this out in the wild anyway.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I also considered the movement between a pass as a run only if the 
        displacement met a length threshold. In this case the cut off was a length
        of 20 units where the pitch has been stretched to fit a 120 X 80 unit size.

    <h3>How To View This</h3>
    <h4>Select a Team</h3>

    <p>
        I have used data for some EPL games from the 2019/20 season until March 2020.
        I've used only teams which haven't had any managerial changes
        during the season because a consistent strategy over the whole season
        is easier to capture than a mix of two or more stategies.
    </p>
    
    <p>        
        There are extra comments for Liverpool which may help you understand
        what's happening more easily so if you're seeing this
        for the first time then you may want to choose Liverpool.
    </p>

    <h4>Viewing Pointers</h3>

    <p>
        Different colours mean different scales. The brightest red is not the same
        as the brightest blue is not the same as the brightest yellow, etc.
        Comparing the brightness of two different colours is meaningless.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can opt to compare different selections on a common colour scale by 
        leaving "Scale color relative only to selection" unchecked. By checking it 
        you shrink the colour scale to span 
        only across the selection's numbers rather than the common
        colour scale which makes it easier to see patterns for players which don't
        have very strong numbers for either probabilities or overall contribution.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        I'd also recommend a high-ish brightness setting and disabling 
        your red tinting software if you have it on.

    <p>
        The models that I'm familiar with that people use to perform this 
        sort of analysis are listed below along with my opinion on the
        advatanges or disadvantages of each of them compared to xPo. 
    </p>

    
    <h3>xG chain</h3>

    <p>
        The motive behind this model is to split credit for goals / shots 
        amongst all the participants involved in the play leading up to it, so 
        in a way it's not doing exactly the same thing as xPo. However, adding
        these up across actions or matches, etc. has been an oft used metric
        to establish the overall credit players should get towards their team's
        goals.
    </p>

    <p>
        This takes the xG of the shot and splits it up equally between all
        actions in that play. It's quick and simple and easy to understand. This
        does not, however, assign a value to every action. It only assigns a
        value to an action that led to a shot.
    </p>

    <h3>xThreat</h3>

    <p>
        xT tries to assign a value to having the ball in a certain part of the
        pitch. The value of an action is therefore the difference between the
        value of the ball being in its start position, before the action, and
        in its end position, after the action.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some things that I consider pros for xPo over xT -
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            xPo assigns a value to an action executed from and, when relevant, 
            to a set of coordinates. xT assigns a value to the ball being in a 
            certain part of the pitch.
        </li>
        <li>
            xPo distinguishes a pass and a run and assigns a separate value 
            to both. xT counts both as ball movement and clubs them together.
        </li>
        <li>
            xPo does not draw a grid on the pitch, it is calculated for any
            area or pair of areas on the pitch and can be calculated for any 
            resolution. xT considers a grid on the pitch and is evaluated for a 
            block in the grid. A small movement
            on the pitch may move you across blocks and change your xT value 
            unrealistically but your xPo value should not get affected so much.
            Karun mentioned that this can be worked around by interpolating 
            the xT values for coordinates that fall between the centers of
            the grid.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Some things that I consider pros for xT over xPo -
    </p>

    <ul>
        
        <li>
            xPo only cares for the action and the end outcome of that play and
            assumes that by averaging over all the plays the ensuing actions
            get incorporated somehow in the xPo value. xT explicitly considers
            possible sequences of play going through various parts of the pitch.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            xPo only gives credit when a shot happened at the end of the play
            whereas xT also gives credit even for situations where they got into
            a possible shooting position even if they didn't actually shoot.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        And some trade offs -
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            xPo may spread the data too thin since it tries to capture an
            event between any pair of coordinates. xT models a block in the grid
            so there is sufficient data but it might mix too many situations
            together.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>VAEP</h3>

    <p>
        This uses the last three actions at any point in time, and various 
        attributes of those three actions as inputs to a function that estimates
        the probability that a goal will be scored or conceded in the next 10 
        moves. 
    </p>

    <p>
        VAEP has two main advantages over xPo. Firstly, VAEP is a far more robust 
        formulation given that it considers all these extra attributes. Second, 
        it incorporates the probability of conceding so you also get an idea of  
        the downside of an action.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The main disadvantage of it though is that given it's such a rich formulation,
        it will need quite a lot of data to calibrate. xPo is just a slightly complex 
        aggregation of whatever 
        data is made available to it and it doesn't need to be calibrated.
        It can therefore be run on small sets of data too and return a more 
        specific set of values for, say, a team or a player which can be 
        important if their playing styles are distinct from others.
    </p>

    <h3>Opta's Possession Value</h3>

    <p>
        I don't think they have revealed their methodology but they estimate a
        value based on the probability of scoring or conceding after an action.
        The only
        thing they have revealed is that they use 5 previous moves to estimate
        the PV. The pros and cons, I imagine, would thus be similar to VAEP.
